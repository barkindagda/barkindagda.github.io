    <h3>HighwayLLM: Decision-Making and Navigation in Highway Driving with RL-Informed Language Model</h3>
    <p>This study presents a novel approach, HighwayLLM, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to predict future waypoints for ego-vehicle navigation, combined with a pre-trained RL model for high-level planning. The method integrates LLM, RL, and PID-based control to create interpretable, safe, and efficient navigation strategies for autonomous driving.

    <h3>Behavioral Cloning Models Reality Check for Autonomous Driving</h3>
    <p>How effective are recent advancements in autonomous vehicle perception systems when applied to real-world autonomous vehicle control? While numerous vision-based autonomous vehicle systems have been trained and evaluated in simulated environments, there is a notable lack of real-world validation for these systems. This paper addresses this gap by presenting the real-world validation of state-of-the-art perception systems that utilize Behavior Cloning (BC) for lateral control, processing raw image data to predict steering commands. The dataset was collected using a scaled research vehicle and tested on various track setups. Experimental results demonstrate that these methods predict steering angles with low error margins in real-time, indicating promising potential for real-world applications.

    <h3>Autonomous Nuclear Material Transportation</h3>
    <p><strong>Cyclopic</strong></p>
    <p>A comprehensive feasibility study conducted for Sellafield's Gamechangers Challenge, focusing on secure and reliable systems for autonomous nuclear material transportation in GPS-denied environments. The report evaluates communication solutions (Mesh Networks, SATCOM, and Radio), sensor technologies, localization methods, and collision avoidance strategies. Key contributions include multi-sensor fusion approaches for robust localization, reinforcement learning-based behavioral planning, and redundancy systems to achieve zero-failure transportation of sensitive materials. The study recommends mesh networks for communication reliability, adaptive multi-sensor fusion for localization, and modular reinforcement learning systems for collision avoidance.</p>

    <h3>VLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Emergency Braking in Occluded Pedestrian Crossing</h3>
    <p>This work investigates the use of vision-language models (VLMs) as semantic priors to guide reinforcement learning policies in high-risk traffic scenarios. The focus is on emergency braking in occluded pedestrian crossings, where traditional vision systems struggle with uncertainty. Our approach combines zero-shot VLM reasoning with an RL agent to learn safe and proactive braking behaviors under limited observability. This hybrid system aims to reduce false negatives and improve response time by using the VLM’s understanding of pedestrian context and likely movements, even in visually ambiguous situations. Experimental results in simulated urban driving environments demonstrate significant improvements in braking accuracy and safety compared to traditional RL-only or vision-only systems.</p>
